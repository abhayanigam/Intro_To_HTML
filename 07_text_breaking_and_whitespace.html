    Impoertant Notes:
        Text Breaking and Whitespace : There are specific elements we can use to
                                        instruct the browser how to do that.
        Some Character Entities are -

        1. <pre></pre> - WHich tell the client most of the time the browser (That this particular 
                        content has been preformatted)

        2. <br/> or <br> - br or break element that allows you to to specifically tell the browser to 
                            add a line break at that point.

        3. <hr/> or <hr>- hr or horizontal rule , that allows you to to put a horizontal line
                            right across the page.

        4. &nbsp; - This is genrally known as a character entity and this is a particular type of markup
                    we can provide to the browser *That represent a character that's special*
                    nbsp stand for (Non breaking space)

        5. &lt; and &gt; - That represent the less than and greater than symbols. We use these particular 
                            symbols in order to denote in the HTML.(&lt; -> (<) and &Lt; -> (<<) )
                            
        6. &copy; - Character Entity is used to print copyright symbol instead of text.
