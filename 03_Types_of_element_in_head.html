    Important Notes:-

    Inside the head element, there are six key child elements, or elements that we've put inside of there.
    
    1. <title> - Gives us a title of the page 
    2. <meta> - The meta element allow us to provide metadata about the document that
                can be anything from the viewport
    3. <script> - That allows us to write inside the document or linking to another document some script or
                    code that can make our page more interactive.
    4. <style> - styles or additional information about how to render certain content.
    5. <link> - Link which can provide links to a variety of different types of resources that are related to our page.
    6. <base> - base allows to specify a base address with which all our links to other documents will be based on.
