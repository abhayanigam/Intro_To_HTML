    Important Notes:
        > Adding images to a page:
            Multiple Sources
            Using images in your page.

        > Including Images in a page:-
            1. src - Where can the image file be found.
                    example - src = "coffee.png"

            2. alt - text to display or read in place of the image.
                    example - alt = "coffee.com"

            3. height/width - control display sizing.
                                example - height = "150 px" widht = "150 px"

        > ALternate Image Size.
            Provide Different sizes of the same image set viewport relative sizes based on the media query

            1. srcset - srcset attribute , which allows us to provide different sources, different files with the image
                        in them , that will have different sizes.
                        example - srcset = "logo.png 50w , logo-250.png 250w"

            2. sizes - sizes to go along with that , that tell the browser when you , render this i want you to make it relative 
                        to the viewport, that viewable ara  of the browser window. And what it does is it allows the browser to make
                        smart decisions about which image file to use and how to render it and how much of the visible space it should 
                        be taking up on the particular page  that the user's viewing.
            (vw) -> view window

        > Using Picture to select images
            Select images based on media querie
            Select images based on supported image formats
                Example: 
                    <picture
                        <source type = "image/jpg" srcset = " " sizes = " " />
                        <source type = "image.png" srcset = " " sizes = " " />
                        <img src = "" alt = "" />
                    />
